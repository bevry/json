# History

## v1.4.0 2021 July 30

## v1.3.0 2021 July 30

-   TypeScript generics so you can specify the type of data you are working with.
-   Uses [`@bevry/file`](https://github.com/bevry/file) internally to safely read and write the files, and provide detailed errors if such fails and why.
-   Add `deleteJSON` to delete a json file (doesn't actually care if it is indeed a json file, will delete the file regardless of its extension).
-   Dropped the encoding param, as `utf8` is most convenient.
